# Words
Words is a library that parses phrases, applies stemming and filters stop words. In other words, it does most of the operations needed
before builging text search indexes.

The library supports Greek letters, stemmer and stop word sets. Currently, Greek support is integrated in the code and I am planning to
make it optional. Until then, it is fairly easy to do it, once someone understands the code.
